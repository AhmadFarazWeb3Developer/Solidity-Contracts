-> A User sends pseduo-transaction object called a UserOperation
   to a seperate mempool, called the Alt-mempool.

-> A special class actor, called a bundler, package up a set of these UserOperation
   objects into a transaction.

-> This transaction is sent to a special contract called EntryPoint.sol,
   which processes each UserOperation via the handleOps function (or handleOp if it's one at a time).

-> The bundled transaction is then gets included in a block.

-> The user operation will come from frontend, contains:

  const userOp = {
    sender: predictedAccount,
    callData,
    initCode,
    signature,
    paymasterAndData,
    ...
  };
